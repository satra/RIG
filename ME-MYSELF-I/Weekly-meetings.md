During Neurohackweek we discussed creating an open course in neuro data science. We plan to use [this Github organization](https://github.com/neuro-data-science)  and a [course discussion is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LY7U_v01RieRWiNGRa-dpSwLyOKk1Hjed9Do6Ejtrao/edit). We encourage people to continue refining these ideas and to create material to support educating neuroscientists in data science.
