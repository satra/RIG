# Group Project Management Template

This repository contains issues related to the management of all group projects along with weekly progress records for all group members and collaborators.

Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/satra/RIG/projects/1) for more information.

## Working open

At the group we are dedicated to working as openly as possible. We believe that our endeavors will be more successful through clear communication and collaboration than by keeping secrets. This repository is designed to showcase our "work in progress". You're welcome to help out along the way!

We may have private repositories if our collaborators are more comfortable with restricted working on some projects, but we aspire to "be the change" and demonstrate open working practices wherever possible.

## Onboarding

If you're new to the group, check out the [Onboarding repository](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) which will talk you through the different exercises and actions for your first few weeks in the group.
